# Swapper

This is a full-stack JS application built with Node, Express, mongoDB, Bootstrap and uses PassportJS for user authentication.
The goal of this app is to allow remote/freelance workers the opportunity to find and swap workspaces with other workers around the world. 

This app is a work in progress. Right now there is CRUD functionality for workspaces and reviews. The next features I plan to work on will be integrating Google Maps to show the location, search functionality, and a review system.
